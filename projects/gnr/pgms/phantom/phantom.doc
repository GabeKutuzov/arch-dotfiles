    Standard ROCKS conventions apply and the usual generic control
cards (TITLE, etc.) are available.  There are no ordering restrictions
on phantom control cards, except that each type of object is placed on
the lattice given by the most recent LATTICE card.  x is always hori-
zontal, y vertical, and z is the section coordinate.  The origin is at
the upper left hand corner of each section.  Negative densities will
cause the object to be subtracted from whatever objects came before.


FILE fnm

    fnm = name of acrNEMA image file to be written.

STUDY study

    study = study number for acrNEMA header.

SERIES series

    series = study series number for acrNEMA header.

NOTE note

    note = comment or note field for acrNEMA header.  Remember to
           place the note in quotes if it contains blanks or other
           special characters.

IMAGE SIZE cols rows secs

    cols,rows,secs = size of image in pixels along x,y,z.

PIXEL SIZE xpix ypix zpix

    xpix,ypix,zpix = size of one pixel along x,y,z in mm.

NOISE  sigma  [seed]

    sigma = mean and standard deviation of Poisson-distributed
            noise added to all pixels in image.
    seed = random number generating seed (default: 1009).

LATTICE  [x1 y1 z1  [x2 y2 z2  [x3 y3 z3]]]

    There may be from 0 to 3 vectors on a LATTICE card.
    x1,y1,z1 = x,y,z translations of first lattice vector in mm.
    x2,y2,z2 = x,y,z translations of second lattice vector in mm.
    x3,y3,z3 = x,y,z translations of third lattice vector in mm.

BRICK  rho  xo yo zo  x1 y1 z1  x2 y2 z2  x3 y3 z3

    rho = density to be assigned to each pixel inside a brick.
    xo,yo,zo = position of geometric center of one brick in mm.
    x1,y1,z1 = vector defining one edge of brick in mm.
    x2,y2,z2 = vector defining second edge of brick in mm.
    x3,y3,z3 = vector defining third edge of brick in mm.

CYLINDER  rho  xo yo zo  xc yc zc  radius

    rho = density to be assigned to each pixel inside a cylinder
    xo,yo,zo = position of center of one cylinder in mm.
    xc,yc,zc = vector defining axis of cylinder in mm.
    radius = radius of cylinder in mm.

SPHERE  rho  xo yo zo  diameter

    rho = density to be assigned to each pixel inside a sphere
    xo,yo,zo = position of center of one sphere in mm.
    diameter = diameter of sphere in mm.
