Introduction

mfdraw  Feature / Function Overview

mfdraw  Operation

	Startup

	Shutdown

        Preferences / Settings / Command Line
	(9) We really need a command-line parameter that specifies the
	maximum memory to be used for storing frame commands (as opposed
	to the present setting of the maximum number of frames).  This
	should not be an environment parameter.  If the guidelines are
	implemented as outlined above, there is really no reason this
	cannot be changed up or down (with some fixed minimum) during a
	run via a right-click menu item.  There should be a default in
	the preferences file that will be used if the command-line
	parameter is not found at start up.

	[parameters are set at compile-time, command-line, or preferences
         file, and from the metafile header ... we need a table with
         columns xxx-time and rows for parmeters and cells implementation
         method eg right click dialog, menu option, command line etc.]  

Frame Viewing
	Frame Sequence
	(8a) The program should keep track of the order in which frames
	are viewed when the user applies any of the controls mentioned above.
	The size of this list should be a preference file item, with default
	100 frames.  Each time the '&lt;' button is clicked with the CTRL key
	held down, the program goes to the next previous frame on this list,
	i.e. undoes a GoTo.  Each time the '&gt;' button is clicked with the
	CTRL key held down, the program goes to the next frame moving forward
	on this list.  See implementation suggestion (5).
				
Frame Initialization

Frame Inheritance
	(8) The rules of inheritance are modified as follows:  Whenever
	the user views frames in number order, i.e. using '&lt;', '&lt;&lt;',
	'&gt;', or '&gt;&gt;' buttons, or in movie mode, each frame inherits
	the window size (unless the aspect ratio changes due to the
	frame size given in the file) and position, magnification,
	origin offset, and background color of the most recently viewed
	frame.  If 'GoTo' or '|&lt;' is used to view a frame already viewed
	that is not the immediate previous or next frame in frame number
	order, then the parameters of that frame when it was most recently
	viewed will apply.  If 'GoTo' or '&gt;|' is used to view a frame not
	already viewed (in a metafile), it should inherit from the highest-
	numbered frame in memory that is below the requested frame
        and with the same page dimensions.

	If implemented as in implementation suggestion (2) below, the inherited
	values can also be stored with all of the unviewed frames that are
	skipped over.
        [what does this mean - an example would be helpful]

	   When the frame size requested by a new frame command in the
	input metafile or socket is different from the value that would
	be inherited according to the above rules, the size in the
	header takes precedence.  The current behavior is good the
	way it is, please do not change it.

	Mode Selection and Change
	(9d) Transition from still mode to movie mode:  With the current
	frame positioned anywhere in the list of viewable frames, the user can
	get to movie mode via the 'M' key or the right-click menu.  The first
	thing that happens is that mfdraw requests a new frame from the
	application if one is not already pending.  Then, if the currently
	displayed frame is not the most recent frame, mfdraw quickly steps
	through the frames in memory, as it does now, displaying each one for
	a brief time (using the preference file minimum-time item) until the
	displayed frame is the most recent frame.  Then it changes the global
	switch to movie mode and continues as above.  No other special action
	needed.

	Version  
	(Date: Sun, 20 Jan 2008)Maybe you should have
	some mechanism to show the compilation date in the File->About
	menu item.

	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	Modes

Metafile
    (7) Metafile viewing should behave as follows:  On startup, the
    program should read the first frame and display it immediately.  It
    should then continue reading (but not displaying) frames in the
    background until the number of frames specified by the in-memory limit
    is reached (or, of course, fewer if the metafile contains fewer than
    this number of frames).  The navigation buttons then work within this
    set, except that, when located at the last in- memory frame, the
    '&gt;' button results in reading one more frame (and discarding a
    frame (or frames when (9) is implemented) if necessary); the
    '&gt;&gt;' button steps to the last frame if not already located
    there, then continues reading new frames and deleting old frames until
    stopped by a button as detailed above or by reaching the end of the
    metafile.

    (10) Regarding navigation when reading from a metafile on disk:
    The new thing here is that we want to be able to use arrow keys and
    Goto to access any frame in the metafile.  (This would not apply
    when reading from a socket.)  This clearly requires being able to
    reread frames that may have previously been discarded from memory.
    Implementation suggestions are given below.

    (2 implementation) Regarding reading metafiles:  Supposing I add a
    data item at the end of the metafile that records how many frames are
    in that file, so you do not have to scan through to count them but can
    just do a seek to the end of the file to read the number of frames;
    then it seems to me you could allocate space for your index structures
    for all the frames in the metafile, which we agree is not a lot of
    memory, but populate those index structures only when the frames are
    actually read, so there is not too long a startup delay.  When the
    current memory limit is full, delete frames in order from least
    recently viewed (see above) until the memory is below the limit.
       So, whether I go through starting at frame 1 and clicking Next over
    and over, or use Goto and view in some crazy random order, what the
    code has to do is go to the index, see if that frame is in memory, if
    so, display it, if not, read it in and note in its index slot that it
    is now in memory and where it is.
       One of the items in the index has to be the seek location of that
    frame in the metafile.  If the user uses Goto to view frames out of
    order, it may be necessary in this situation to scan through the
    metafile from the last frame whose seek location is known to find the
    requested frame.  The seek locations of the frames skipped over can
    still be recorded in the index so these can be found quickly when
    needed later.  This overhead will be unavoidable (it replaces reading
    the entire metafile at startup as is done now), but will be relatively
    rare in practice.



Still
    (9a) Socket-still mode:  We always want to request from the
    application just one more frame than the highest frame number ever
    viewed.  [need a precise definition of "viewed". 
    The user can click Next and Previous and Goto ad lib anywhere
    within what is in memory, but a new frame is requested from the
    application only when the latest frame is viewed.  When memory fills,
    lowest-numbered frames are thrown out until enough memory is freed
    up.  This prevents creating gaps in the set of viewable frames.
    When the user tries to use the Back or Goto button to go back to a
    frame that has been removed, there is an error beep as already
    mentioned above.
       Note that the situation I observed with the 9/11 version cannot
    happen now, as long as you keep enough spare memory to receive one
    new frame.  You will never be throwing away a frame except when the
    latest frame is being viewed and when that happens, you will always
    be throwing away just one or more of the earliest frames.  The user
    will not be able to go back to those, but he/she will never see a
    discontinuity within the stack of viewable frames.

    (3 implementation) Reading from a socket.  Now we do not know in
    advance how many frames there will be.  As we discussed on
    9/12/07, you can allocate index space, but not frame command
    space, for some large number that is a compile-time constant,
    e.g. 10000.  I suppose that if that number is ever exceeded, a
    realloc() would take care of it (this requires that there be no
    pointers in the structs that point to other items in the
    index--offsets must be used instead so they do not have to change
    when a realloc() occurs) or the program could keep the index as a
    circular list and when full throw away old index entries along
    with the frames they point to.


Movie
Batch
    (9b) Socket-movie mode.  When in movie mode, either viewing
    current frames or navigating, mfdraw requests frames from the
    application until the memory quota is filled.  When the currently
    viewed frame is more than half way through the cache of frames in
    memory, and a new frame is received, mfdraw (a) removes old frames
    if necessary to make enough memory to hold the new frame on the
    list of frames that are recorded in the index, (b) puts a pointer
    to the new frame in the index, (c) asks the application for another
    frame, and (d) (if in true movie mode) displays the new latest one.

    (9d) Transition from still mode to movie mode:  With the current
    frame positioned anywhere in the list of viewable frames, the user can
    get to movie mode via the 'M' key or the right-click menu.  The first
    thing that happens is that mfdraw requests a new frame from the
    application if one is not already pending.  Then, if the currently
    displayed frame is not the most recent frame, mfdraw quickly steps
    through the frames in memory, as it does now, displaying each one for
    a brief time (using the preference file minimum-time item) until the
    displayed frame is the most recent frame.  Then it changes the global
    switch to movie mode and continues as above.  No other special action
    needed.
	Note that if the user does not desire stepping through all the
    frames as described here, he/she need only press the '&gt;|' button
    before entering movie mode.

    (mfdraw 3/18/2008 implementation) movie mode and batchmode are
    identical except upon reciept of MFB_CLOSE. upon reciept of MFB_CLOSE
    in batchmode we close Cns and close mfdraw.

		User Actions

File
	Open File

	Settings 

	Preferences:
	(2) There will be a user-editable preferences file.  This file will be
	called ".mfdrawrc".  When mfdraw starts up in metafile mode with the
	file name on the command line, it will look for this file first in the
	directory where the current metafile being viewed was found, then in
	the home directory of the current user.  In other modes, the first of
	these is not applicable, and the second refers to the home directory
	of the user under whose userid the program is being run.  In the event
	that neither preferences file is found, the program will use
	compile-time defaults for all preferences.
	   Items for inclusion in the preferences file, but not limited to
	these, are:  Startup location of main window, background color,
	minimum frame viewing time for fast-forward and fast-reverse buttons,
	default X display, default index size, maximum number of frames to
	store in memory (temporary), maximum memory to be devoted to storing
	frames in memory (permanent).
	   If the startup size is not given in the preferences file, the
	existing defaults are excellent and should continue to be used.  (This
	option ignored if not supported by the window system in use.)
	   I would like to be able to specify startup location by one of the
	following options or similar, or with explicit x,y coordinates.: ULHC,
	URHC, LLHC, LRHC -- Upper left-hand corner, etc., Center, Center Left,
	Center Right, Center Top, Center Bottom.  (This option ignored if not
	supported by the window system in use.)
