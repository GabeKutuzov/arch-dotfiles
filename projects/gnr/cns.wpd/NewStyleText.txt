	Sometimes you may want to restore your model to a known state at intervals during a simulation, for example, each time a new stimulus is applied.  Alternatively, you may want to simulate the passage of time between trials or trial series without running a detailed simulation during those times.  The Group III RESET control card is provided to control these manipulations, which are known as resets.  Six levels of resets are defined and five kinds of time intervals at which a reset of any level can be applied.  In addition, specific actions can be applied to reset external or simulated effector devices.

	Reset levels can be specified by number or by name.  The numbers increase according to the severity of the reset; the corresponding names describe the times at which that particular reset level might normally be applied.  The reset levels and their names are: Level 0 (NONE), 1 (CYCLE), 2 (OLDTRIAL), 3 (TRIAL), 4 (SERIES), and 5 (FULL).  For example, CYCLE reset only decays cell activation levels, TRIAL reset simulates the passage of a given time interval with no inputs to any cells, while SERIES reset sets all activity variables to the values they would take on if infinite time had passed with no inputs to any cells.  The times at which resets may occur also have names: TRIAL (reset occurs before each trial begins), TIMER (reset occurs when a specified timer expires), EVENT (reset occurs when triggered by an external event from an attached platform or BBD device), SERIES (reset occurs when a new trial series begins), and NOW (reset occurs when the RESET control card is read).
