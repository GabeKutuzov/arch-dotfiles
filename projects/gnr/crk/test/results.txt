#                    Diehard DNA Test.
# 
#   The DNA test considers an alphabet of 4 letters::  C,G,A,T,
# determined by two designated bits in the sequence of random   
# integers being tested.  It considers 10-letter words, so that 
# as in OPSO and OQSO, there are 2^20 possible words, and the   
# mean number of missing words from a string of 2^21  (over-    
# lapping)  10-letter  words (2^21+9 "keystrokes") is 141909.   
# The standard deviation sigma=339 was determined as for OQSO   
# by simulation.  (Sigma for OPSO, 290, is the true value (to   
# three places), not determined by simulation.                  
# 
# Note 2^21 = 2097152
# Note also that we don't bother with overlapping keystrokes 
# (and sample more rands -- rands are now cheap).
