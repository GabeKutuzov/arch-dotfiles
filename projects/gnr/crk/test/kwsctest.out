It is correct to get invalid numeric value and too long flags on each card above.

Begin test of unusual codes and errors...

   AMB=18,XYZ=99,VAL1,X1,X2,NAME=GNR,OPTION,INC1=5,INC2=7
***Keyword unrecognized or invalid in context.
***Ambiguous abbreviation.
kwscan of card 2 gave ic = 00000030, rc = 1
X1 exit reached
kwscan of card 2 gave ic = 00000038, rc = 2
X2 exit reached
***Option >>INC2<< is incompatible with previously entered options.
kwscan of card 2 gave ic = 0000003F, rc = 0
IC value is OK

card2 test completed, should have given:
   Ambiguous key message for AMB
   Unrecognized key message for XYZ
   X1 and X2 exits reached
   Incompatible option for INC2.

Begin test of key updating, value adjustment, 64-bit and wseed input.

kwscan of card 3 gave ic = 000000F8, rc = 0
IC value is OK

   R1=1009,R2=(34567,2106798003),R3=67890123456

***MAGNITUDE OF NUMERIC VALUE ==>|67890123456|<== MUST BE < 2147483648.
kwscan of card 4 gave ic = 000000E0, rc = 0
IC value is OK
R3 should give 'too big' error.

   OPT1=TRUE,OPT2=FALSE,OPT3,OPT4=0,OPT5=1
kwscan of card 5 gave ic = 000000F8, rc = 0
IC value is OK

   OPT1=TRUE,OPT2=FALSE,OPT3,OPT4=0,OPT5=1
kwscan of card 5 gave ic = 000000F8, rc = 0
IC value is OK

***Keyword unrecognized or invalid in context.
kwscan of card 6 gave ic = 000000D0, cc = 0
IC value is OK

card6 test completed, should have given:
   Unrecognized key message for IT.ITJ4
End kwscan/eqscan tests, 50 correct, 0 failed
