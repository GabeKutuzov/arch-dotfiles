The k_means currently in the program made some bad clusters with some
of A Bubnys's data.  Look into replacing with newer code in NECO last
month.

It seems that some methods use different numbers of dimension when they
do k_means (e.g. Lin 3, Watters 2).  So there should be cluster plots
for both ways of looking at the data.  Look at what would be separate
appropriate plots for each method.

Think about whether there is a way to have the program automatically
select the best history_depth.

Update notes in distribution about the paper, which is now published,
not in press.
