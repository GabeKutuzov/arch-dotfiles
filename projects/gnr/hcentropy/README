SUMMARY:
    This collection of MATLAB programs runs seven entropy
    estimators on input interspike interval (ISI) data from neural
    spike trains.  The estimators involved are the following:

INSTALLATION:  All the programs are written in MATLAB except C-language
    "mex" files are called from the MATLAB code for the Strong et al.
    method and for the multidimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic 
    ("MDKSS") used to compare synthetic and real data sets in the
    history clustering and synthetic data methods.
       The MDKSS code is available from the same location as this code:
    http://lab.rockefeller.edu/reeke/techpub.  You must first download
    that code and install it according to the instructions given in the
    accompanying "readme" file.  Makefiles are provided to make C-
    callable library files for 32- and 64-bit bit systems and to run
    the MATLAB "mex" compilation command for 64-bit systems.  This is
    easily modified by the user if needed for 32-bit systems.  If you
    are not running Linux, you are on your own here.  Once you have
    made and tested the MDKSS mex functions, add the location where
    they are stored to your MATLAB path.
       If you do not plan to run the Strong et al. method, all you
    need to do is unpack the distribution file (tgz or zip) into some
    directory and work there.  If you want to run the Strong et al.
    code, and you have the gcc compiler, just run the following
    command after unpacking the files:  mex strongmx.c.

USAGE:
    The primary program is hcentropy.m.  All the other programs are
    called by this one.  The program hcentropy.m requires one input,
    an ordered sequence of interspike intervals (ISIs) from a neural
    spike train.  There are a few parameters at the beginning of
    hcentropy.m that can be varied to perform certain tasks (e.g.
    controlling which estimators to run, plotting data, etc.).  Please
    look in hcentropy.m for a full description of all the options.

    A demonstration Matlab script is provided in the file demo.m.
    This script uses downloaded data found in the 'data' subdirectory
    of the distribution directory.  Provenance and terms of usage
    for these data are documented in the demo.m file.  The parameters
    in hcentropy.m are appropriate for the demo run--you will want to
    edit these for any real application; in particular, increase the
    bootstrap_num parameter from 200 to a value that will give better
    error bounds -- we usually use 10000.

    NOTE:  Very small ISIs in the data, perhaps the result of noise
    in the experiment, will cause problems with some of the methods.
    It is best to examine the data before running this package and
    remove such data, either by hand or with a programmed filter.

REVISION HISTORY:
Note:  Revision numbers are numbers assigned by the "subversion"
version control package used to maintain different versions of
this software.
Rev. 1, 08/15/13:  Code exactly as used to run experiments in the
    Neural Computation manuscript.
Rev. 2, 10/11/13:  As in Rev. 1 except copyright and GPL license
    notification added and trivial code changes made: some comments
    revised and reformatted, error() calls added or text changed,
    waitbar added, kind_entropy switch added, etc.  demo.m script
    added and for demo, ITERTYPE was changed to 1 and bootstrap_num
    was reduced to 2000.
Rev. 3, 01/24/14:  Changed bootstrappping for all bootstrapped methods
    so that bootstrapping draws with replacement from only a designated
    portion of the data, not the entire dataset.
    Removed "iter" input for all bootstrapped estimators.
    Added Lin & Reeke and Kozachenko & Leonenko estimators.
    Removed output fwte and associated superfluous or redundant code.
    Added code to "print" answer matrix.
Rev. 4, 03/17/14:  Added strongmx mex file to compute Strong et al.
    entropy by literature method or alternative with digitization
    of ISI lengths rather than use of binary bins.  Added to strong.m
    ability to plot progress of regression of entropy vs word length.
    Modified hcentropy.m to control these options and corrected bug
    to allow runs with bootstrap_num = 1.  Corrected bug in koz_leo.m
    that incorrectly determined amount of noise to add to input data.
    This was code used for accepted version of Neural Comp. manuscript.
Rev. 5, 03/18/14:  Removed old code for Strong et al. method that
    omitted some values of word length.  Updated comments.
Rev. 6, 05/12/14:  Modified to use mex file code for multidimensional
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.  Deleted redundant emc.m and
    nelderm.m files.  Updated README.
Rev. 7, 06/12/14:  Added waitbar for artificial data method and
   SHOW_PROGRESS switch.  Corrected bug that stopped run when a
   substring could not be analyzed in the Monte-Carlo comparison of
   aritifical with real data.  Corrected bug that printed differential
   instead of discrete entropy for artificial data method.  Turned on
   direct bin method, ma bound, and default bin width in demo.
Rev. 8, 06/12/14:  Updated revision history in this README.
