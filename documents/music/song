[Intro Filler]

Whistles of glass bottles open every night as the window opens.
I was wrong again as per usual. (Humming)

With every sip went a memory of the good and less of the bad.
So I sit and think of the times I wish you and I had.

We left behind so many wasted years,
And all because of stupid propagated, fabricated, fears.

[Filler]

The world keeps spinning and time never stops.
I was sinking into a deep blue sea of a stressed out world.

["Bridge"]
You gave me a worn out life vest full of holes,
you told me to swim to a boat that sits in the deepest part of the fog.

[Normal]
I said the truth, why dont you do the same
Instead you hear my voice and all you do is run away.

I never paddled so hard in my life before,
Without the effort I know I'll never see the shore.

[Filler] [Slower Tempo Now]

Now I see the boat that once was miles away
It blends into the fog with nothing to say.

I knew all along this boat would leave me,
though I thought the hope inside me would keep me from the sea.
