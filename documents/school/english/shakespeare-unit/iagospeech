Iago's Speech Interpretation

Speech:

   Thus do I ever make my fool my purse; For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profame, If I would time expend with such a snipe. But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor; And it is thought aborad that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office: I know not if 't b true; But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; The better shalle my purpose work on him, Cassio's a proper man: let me see now; To get his place, and to plume up my will In double knavery - How, how? - Let's see: - After some time, to abuse Othello's ear That he is too familiar with his wife. He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be susected; framed to make women false. The Moor is of a free and open nature, That thinks men honest that but seem to be so; And will be tenderly be led by the nose As assess are.
I Haven't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

Interpretation:
   Iago is contemplating whether it makes sense for him to be
hateful right now. He is coming up with reasons to hate and not
to
hate.
