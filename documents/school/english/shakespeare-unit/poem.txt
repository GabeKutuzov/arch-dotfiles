Othello Poem

Desdemona my love, what I would do for you.
Of all that love you, how shall you see me first?
Perhaps to kill a man merciless, or rather two.
Feasibly send one to do the dirty, then have him cursed.

For all that I know, my schemes are likely to flourish,
send Roderigo to kill our mutual foe and spare my energy.
I may sit and collect to prepare as I am sluggish,
no need to watch the fool on his kness for his life, beggarly.

With the passing of time, I wait anxiously for my next move.
For suddenly the ambush begins, Roderigo failed his final task.
The anger boils my blood, for my knife through his chest drove. 
Cassio wounded and not knowing it was me, for I had worn a mask.

My final move in executing Iago saved the exposure of my plot.
I watch Othello, another lover, by his own hand he may rot.
