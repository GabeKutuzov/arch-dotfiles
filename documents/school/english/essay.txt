Book:
I am Malala - By Malala Yousafzai

    The autobiography, "I am Malala" by Malala Yousafzai, is in brief
summary about her experience in standing up against the terrible rules that
society has bestowed upon her. Her country had discriminatory laws that
interuppted her opportunity for education, ahd therefore she stood against
it. She was shot for it, and was very lucky to have survived.
    I believe the reason that the author wrote this book because she wanted
to share her experience with fighting for what she believed was right. She 
wants people to know her story, and why she did what she did. She wrote this
because she wants people to understand what it is like to have to go through
a near-death experience because of standing for what you believe in.
    The author claims that education is the most important thing in the
world, and that we must all be given the education that we deserve. Malala
shows how important her claim on the importance of education is by almost
being shot for it. She had the bravery to stand for what she believed in,
and even after a near-death experience, she still pushes the importance of
what she knows is right. One message that is cleary shown here is to be
persistent, and follow what you think is right by not standing for anyone
that impedes you.
    Malala is definitely successful in her purpose. She is a role model
across the entire globe, known for her contributions to society. She has
risen a lot of people to fight for what they believe in, so her message has
clearly made its way to a lot of people, and therefore a succssfully
developed claim on her side.
