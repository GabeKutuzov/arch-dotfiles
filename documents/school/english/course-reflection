Course Reflection
Gabriel Kutuzov

- How did you feel coming to/sitting in this class? Explain in detail. Consider tone, atmosphere, assignments, etc.
   I feel fine coming to and sitting in this class. I like that it's an easy start to the day, where I have a few minutes to clear my head from the quick and breathless morning. The atmostphere and tone was nice, pretty welcoming, also a small class which is nice I suppose. Assignemnts were okay. I liked that there was a lot of independent study. I enjoy allocating my time as I choose.

- What was our favourite aspect of the class? Explain why you liked it.
   My favourite aspect of the entire class was the focus on independent study. As I mentioned previously, independent study is my thing. Ironic, however, considering I am not that great at self-discipline, but I enjoy training the skill.

- What would you suggest improving for next year? Why?
   One thing I would suggest as an improvement for next year would be the addition of very faint music in the background of the class. I enjoy when there is music, and classical music in particular is very relaxing and focus-ing. It's a nice touch when it's a little faint in the background.

- What is your overall reflection? How does it compare to other courses you've taken? Explain.
   Overall reflection was that the course initself compared to the others I have taken, this one kind of tops them all. I don't think I've ever had a first period class where the teacher has enough respect to give us a few minutes in the morning to unwind and settle in, instead of rushing right into some time-wasting work. Ms. Borrelli has also been very helpful in allowing me to pass the class where I definitely should not be. Thank you most sincerely.

- List your favorite memories from our time together. This does not need to be based on academics.
   * Ted Talks.
   * All the times we chatted when you gave us food.
   * Any time we talked about something fun.
(I don't really remember much right now for some reason.)
