Journal Entry #1
Gabriel Kutuzov

   One of the issues that are raised with the first anchor video is the way that problems are addressed. They seem to be addressed in a very irrational and unproductive way, such as yelling and complaining about things. These methods wont contribute to change, and as a matter of fact, will in turn make things worse at the end of the day. The only way to make change happen is with action and not with plain old (possibly hurtful) words. I can see this an an inquiry for a project, because change is soemthing that isimportant for the development of our society and everything in general. Without change, we can't adapt to the world that is naturally shaping itself around us.
