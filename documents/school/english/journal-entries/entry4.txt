Journal Entry #4
Gabriel Kutuzov

   After speaking with my classmates about the topic that I chose for my project, my opinion has not changed. I was told that this is a good topic to work on, because it is a huge concern that could end humanity very quickly. After talking with them, I actually wanted to do this topic more because of the encouragement I received for the good topic. Anyway, as I said before, my opinion for the topic did not change and I still very much do intend on doing it for my project.
