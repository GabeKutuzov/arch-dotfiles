Journal Entry #3
Gabriel Kutuzov

   After completing my preliminary research, I do in fact believe that this topic is sufficient for a semster long inquiry-based project. There is definitely enough evidence for the topic, because Nuclear Warfare is something that has affected the world in the past and continues to affect the way we live, whether we know it or not. The topic is not too broad or too narrow, it's just right. The topic regarding the dangers of Nuclear Weapons is pretty straight-forward and on point. I know this is a good topic to pick, because there is a lot to talk about during the presentation to keep people interested. Things that I could talk about could date from World War 2 and the Cold War, up to the problems we face today due to Nuclear Weapons.
