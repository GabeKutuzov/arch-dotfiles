Journal Entry #5
Gabriel Kutuzov

   After all of the preliminary activities, the thing that led me the most to the topic of Nuclear Weapons was how interesting of a topic it is for me. I have always been fascinated by Nuclear Weapons, only because I find the fact that human beings can end everything they've ever known with a silly invention of theirs (yes, I am sort of speaking in the third-person in some way). I am connected to this topic because I am somewhat of a history lover (I am slightly obsessed).
