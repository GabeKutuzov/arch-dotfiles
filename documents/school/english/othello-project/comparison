   Mark McGuire was neck-to-neck with Sammy Sosa for home runs in 1998. McGuire got 70 home runs, where-as Sosa got 66. Barry Bonds saw the competetition, and was jealous of McGuire for all the fame that he receieved. To his findings, Bonds discovered that McGuire was taking steroids, and so Bonds did the same thing. The jealousy led to him making bad choices, much like Othello's jealousy of what he thought was said of Desdemona led to him killing her. Cassio was speaking to Iago about Bianca, and Othello overheard half of the conversation, not knowing they were talking about Bianca, but assumed that they were talking about Desdemona. This made him think that their was some sort of affair happening between Cassio and his wife.
