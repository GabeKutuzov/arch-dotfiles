Iago Poem

A life full of work and dedication, all for nothing,
for Cassios sweeps in and takes all opportunity from grip.
The rage within me boils, my blood thickens and fists clenching.
I know I will for sure get my revenge, no matter how dreanching.

Roderigo I have found, a man I can possess with my ambition.
"Do this favor for me, kill Cassio and recieve your desires".
My plea washes his mind, throwing his will into my right. 
Death shall come soon to the man that deserves it come night.

Perhaps I will come with Cassio, watch the job done for myself.
Maybe he will fall into trouble, for I will soon react and strike.
And as to my judgement, his plans have betrayed him.
Cassio did no more than injure the target, for I came in with a quick leg trim.
