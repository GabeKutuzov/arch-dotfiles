Dear Doctor Reeke,
   How are you? Here is a small update on the project,
and attached are my time sheets.
   As for dumpmf, everything works as I would like it to.
I moved all of the metafile reading functionality to a library
that I just called "mfreader" for now. I might change the way
it works a little later (check design notes in mfreader.c).
I also made another test program for the plot library called
'cli-test' which is just every plotting command done in
sequential order, as well as some unit tests for the bitstream
reading to make sure it works, as I had some trouble with
values. Dumpmf itself works and prints all the operations
properly, but one small issue is that there are still some
problems with the incorrect values in some places. One other
thing I have to do alongside that is re-implement bitmaps. I just
remembered that dumpmf can't read those yet but I'll get to that
before anything else.
   My next update will be a graphics test for the new mfdraw using
'libmfreader'. Like I mentioned before, I will probably change the way
the library reads operations too.
   By the way, is there a certain limit to the amount of times I could
login to bucephalus per day or something before it blacklists my IP?
I am not sure why this keeps happening. I remember I logged in and
out a couple of times because I was trying to fix something with urxvt,
so maybe that's why I am blacklisted again. I was at my neighbors
doing work there and I logged in once but then the connection timed
out after about five minutes. Just going to use Box right now of course.
   Also, please do let me know if the formatting for this email is
correct and single-spaced as you would like it.
Thanks,
  Gabe
